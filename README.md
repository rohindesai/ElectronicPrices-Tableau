# ELECTRONIC PRICING STRATEGY

## About
The dataset has a collection of different prices of electornic products across 4 years which are sold on different merchants/sellers. In this analysis I have used the dataset and created tableau dashboards to create different visualizations.

## Dataset
This is a list of over 15,000 electronic products with pricing information across 10 unique fields provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. The dataset also includes the brand, category, merchant, name, source, and more.

## Analysis
In the electronic pricing dataset they are 5 main merchants Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, BH Video Audio and Beach Camera. In my tableau dashboard I have analyzed the prices off different products sold on these merchants. And based on the analysis we can come to conclusions on how the prices on a certain product varies across these merchants. Like which merchant sold it for the lowest price or when was the price the lowest. 
Also in my dashboard after analysing the data for all new products sold, the most sales happen on Tuesday followed by Friday. And the least amount of sales is on the Sundays.
And also from the analysis it was determined that there is a correlation between the average maximum and minimum prices of products across the day of the month. After doing a linear regression on the average prices with the day of the month the R Squared values was 0.89 or 89%. From which we can conclude that the day of the month effected the prices of the products. 
From these different analysis we can predict some pricing strategies for merchants selling the same product against other merchants. 

These are some of the screenshot of the dashboard.
